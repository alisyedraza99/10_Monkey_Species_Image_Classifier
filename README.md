# 10_Monkey_Species_Image_Classifier
An Image Classifier made for the 10 Monkey Species data set found on Kaggle using CNNs. 
# The Classifier
The Image Classifier detects 10 different Monkey species. 
The CNN was built using Tensorflow and Keras. Other than the usual Convolutional and 
MaxPooling layers, I used Dropout for regulization. 
Please note I may continue working on this project on [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/alisyedraza99/10-monkeys) which may
be updated before this repo
# The Dataset
the Dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species/downloads/10-monkey-species.zip/2)
